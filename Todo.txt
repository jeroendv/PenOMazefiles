# todo: Elliminate the TokenConsumer class
In python, the producer-consumer or event generator-event listener
pradigm doesn't require that consumer/listener is an object.

In java everything is an object and you can only pass objects around not
functions. Hence in java there is the need to define a listener
interface for each event which must be implemented by any object that
wishes to listen to these events.

In python the listener or consumer can simply be a function. Firing a
new event is as simple as invoking a method with a given set of
arguments.  Whether that function is a module function or a method
related to an object is completely irrelevant.
